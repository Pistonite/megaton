## Section: `check` (Profile Enabled)
Megaton performs a check step after linking the module into an ELF and before converting it to a .nso file. This check allows Megaton to blacklist certain symbols and instructions, preventing an unstable binary from being created.

### Key: `check.ignore` (array of strings)
A list of symbols that the checker will ignore when checking the built binary. 

Inheritance: Override

Default: ["<default>"]

### Key: `check.symbols` (array of strings)
Paths to symbol files generated by `objdump -T`.

Inheritance: Append

Default: []

### Key: `check.disallowed-instructions` (array of strings)
Instructions that are disallowed in the final binary. Place instructions that are known to crash here. (Mostly needed for Megaton tool development).

Inheritance: Override

Default: ["<default>"]
